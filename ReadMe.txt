WindowsKit - a crude AppKit clone for Windows.

A Visual C++ 2010 solution is provided. By default, it builds a static library.
WindowsKit has no external dependencies.  The example is based from the article
Minimalist Cocoa programming by Matt Gallagher, which he posted in his OSX blog
"Cocoa with Love".

The project file should compile fine in Visual Studio 2022.  "Why are you using
VC++ 2010?", asks the one person reading this other than me. Because I like it.
